#GSE109924_lad_D0-rep1.bed is showing the locations and sized of LADs in hg19
#We use

 awk '$1=="chr18"' GSE109924_lad_D0-rep1.bed > lad_chr18.bed'

#to pull out the chromosome 18 specific lads and save it to a new object, lad_chr18.bed

#LADs seem to correspond to areas of low H3K4 monomethylation, as well as 
#trimethylation. H3K17 acetylation not as clear.

#We first have to purge all loaded modules, then load Boost
#Then we get the Chrom3D files from github 
#Change to that directory then mv the Chrom3D folder into the main 3D_day2 folder

#We are looking at one chromosome (chr18).
#97 beads
#71 interactions
#31 peripheral interactions
